# Related Work

In the field of solar energy, there are many research papers dealing
with improving the efficiency of photovoltaic systems. In this context,
two other papers are also relevant: \"Design and development of maximum
power point tracking (MPPT) for 100 watt solar panel base on buck boost
converter\". and \"Performance analysis of solar PV
based DC optimizer distributed system with simplified MPPT method\". 

The first paper deals with the design of an
MPPT system for a 100 W solar module and uses a buck-boost converter.
The second paper investigates the performance of a distributed solar
optimisation system with a simplified MPPT algorithm. 

In contrast to the two aforementioned papers, this work develops an MPPT tracker easily programmable with *Micropython*. The focus here is on the comparison of
the algorithms.
